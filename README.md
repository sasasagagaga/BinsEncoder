# Binning

There are two classes: BinsEncoder and BinsDiscretizer.

BinsDiscretizer is used to split all values of real feature vector into some bins.

BinsEncoder is used to encode each bin with some value.

## TODO list
- [ ] Check and add asserts
- [ ] Make `encode_bins` parameter more flexible may be?
- [ ] Process empty bins borders correctly
- [ ] Process NaNs correctly
